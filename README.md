# Time Series Segmentation paper review

## 2016
### CVPR-2016, Temporal Convolutional Networks for Action Segmentation and Detection
This paper propose a dilated-TCN for action segmentaion for video and time seris.


## 2019
### NIPS-2019, U-Time: A Fully Convolutional Network for Time Series Segmentation Applied to Sleep Staging(link)
Combine the idea of U-net for image segmentationa and TCN and propose an dilated encoder-decoder model for sleep stage classification.
